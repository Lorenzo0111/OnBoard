# Lorenzo0111 Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I created a simple but cool nfc card following the jam. It's a card shaped NFC board that opens an url when you read it

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$48.59

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I started by following the tutorial since it's my first time creating a PCB. Then I designed the card on figma and tried to replicate it on the EasyEDA site
